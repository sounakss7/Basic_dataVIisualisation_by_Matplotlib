Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter and is an open-source library.
It is primarily written in Python, with some segments in C, Objective-C, and JavaScript for platform compatibility1.
Matplotlib is built on top of NumPy arrays and is designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.
Key Features:
Versatile Plotting:
You can create a wide range of plots including line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
It supports both 2D and 3D plotting.
Pyplot Interface:
The pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots.
Customization:
You can customize every aspect of your plots, including colors, labels, line styles, and more.

Matplotlib integrates well with other libraries like pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for statistical data visualization.
